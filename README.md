## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:leuzeus/user-manager.git
cd user-manager
```

### 2. Run the test with docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The tests run via the entrypoint directly. There isn't container.
See the terminal for results

### 3. Alternative Run

You need to install minimum php __8.1__ or above and __Composer__. 
Check to configure php modules. You can look in the Dockerfile to have an idea.


Then run :

```bash
composer install 
php bin/phpunit --testdox
```
